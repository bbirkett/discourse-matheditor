# DiscourseMatheditor

DiscourseMatheditor is a plugin to enter math equations into Discourse in a more user friendly way. This editor helps you to create LaTeX. Please read on wikipedia about it if you dont know what it is: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)
For more documentation on all the LateX commands that you can use please have a look here: [mathlive docs](http://mathlive.io/)

## Installation

Follow [Install a Plugin](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157)
how-to from the official Discourse Meta, using `git clone https://github.com/spirobel/discourse-matheditor.git`
as the plugin command.
You also need to use the official math plugin together with this:
[offical math plugin](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-math-plugin/65770)
I recommend using KateX instead of MathJax, its way faster (at least for me).

## Feedback

If you have issues or suggestions for the plugin, please bring them up on
[Discourse Meta](https://meta.discourse.org).
